## Data Types in Go

Data types are like the personality traits of your variables. They define what kind of data your variables can hold. Is your variable a number? A word? A true/false statement? Or maybe it’s just... there for emotional support? Go has a variety of data types to suit every variable’s needs.

### Basic Data Types in Go

1. Numbers:

   - **Integers** (`int`, `int8`, `int16`, `int32`, `int64`): For whole numbers. Think of them as the "no decimals allowed" club.

   - **Floating-point numbers** (`float32`, `float64`): For numbers with decimals. They’re like integers but with a little - more... flexibility.

   - **Complex numbers** (`complex64`, `complex128`): For when you want to flex your math muscles and go beyond the real world.
2. Strings: 
   - A sequence of characters. Perfect for storing text, like your favorite meme or that passive-aggressive message you’ll never send.

3. Booleans:
   - `true` or `false`. The ultimate binary choice. It’s like deciding if you are good on programming.
4. Zero Values:
   - When you declare a variable but don’t assign a value, Go gives it a default "zero value."

## Functions in Go?

`Functions` are blocks of code that perform a specific task. They’re like mini-programs within your program. You can call them whenever you need them, and they’ll do their job without asking for a coffee break. Functions make your code cleaner, reusable, and easier to manage—because nobody likes a messy codebase.

**Why Use Functions?**
**Reusabiiity**: Write once, use everywhere. It’s like having a favorite recipe you can cook anytime.

**Modularity**: Break your code into smaller, manageable pieces. It’s like organizing your closet instead of throwing everything into one big pile.

**Readability**: Functions make your code easier to understand. It’s like adding subtitles to a movie—everything just makes sense.

### Anatomy of a Function
A function in Go has three main parts:

**Name**: What you call it. Make it descriptive, like calculateArea or sendEmail.

**Parameters**: The inputs it takes. Think of them as the ingredients for your recipe.

**Return Type** : The output it produces. It’s like the finished dish.
